    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel)</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
      <li>½ cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's® Red Hot)</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Place in
        the slow cooker and cover with the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on Low until chicken is cooked through, about 3 hours. Drain
        accumulated juices. Shred chicken using a hand mixer. Add cream cheese,
        sour cream, Buffalo wing sauce, and Cheddar cheese. Cook on Low for 1
        more hour. Stir to combine.

    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For hassle-free cleanup, coat the slow cooker with a light layer of
        nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skip the scrubbing—just pop in a slow cooker liner before cooking.
