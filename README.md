# odin-recipes

This project is to practice my HTML skills by building a simple multi-page recipe site.

## Goals

-Practice HTML basics: heading, lists, links, images.
-Use semantic tags and good structure.
-Organize files and folders clearly.

## Structure

-index.html
-recipes/ (individual recipe pages)
-images/

## How to run

Open 'index.html' in your browser.

## Next steps

-Add 'styles.css' and basic layout.
-Improve accesibility (alt text, headings order).
